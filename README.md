Anti Localization Techniques and Gradient-Following Localization


Usage: 
Put 'locater.c' and 'spoofer.c' into the /contiki-2.7/examples/sky/ folder. Add locater and spoofer to the Makefile.

Run the locater on the gradient-following node and the spoofer on the spoofing node and 'make login' to the tmotes. 
Event output is provided via serial port.



Simulations: Run sim579.m in Matlab with all .m files in the local path folder.

There are various experiments all done from this file, that can easily be replicated with minor code changes /commenting/uncommenting...
